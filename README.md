# Deep Learning Regression with Admissions Data

In this project I have created a deep learning regression model that predicts the likelihood that a student applying to graduate school will be accepted based on various application factors (such as test scores).

### General info

* Data used: [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions)
* Technologies: 
    - For deep learning
      - `tensorflow`, `keras`
    - For cleaning and preparing data
      - `pandas`
    - For splitting dataset and metrics
      - `scikit-learn`
* Model was trained on P100 GPU available via kaggle notebook

### Outcomes

Model I developed, has achived satisfactory results at the level of `R^2 Score = 0.82`. With relatively low `Mean Squared Error = 0.0042` as well as `Mean Absolute Error = 0.0523`.
